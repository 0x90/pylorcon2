+++++++++

PyLorcon2 is a wrapper for the Lorcon2 library.

Lorcon2 (Loss Of Radio CONnectivity) is a generic library for injecting 802.11
frames, capable of injection via multiple driver frameworks, without forcing

Requirements
++++++++++++

PyLorcon2 compiles and runs on Linux. Other OSes may be supported by Lorcon2
but are currently untested.

Python >= 2.5 and Lorcon2 are required to build PyLorcon2:

  * Python >=2.5 and it's headers
    http://www.python.org
  * Lorcon2 and it's headers
    http://802.11ninja.net/lorcon/

Linux users running a binary distribution may need to install the development
packages for Python (e.g. python-devel). You also need a C-compiler like gcc.



Installing
++++++++++

Unpack the source-code into a new directory like this:

    tar xvzf PyLorcon2-0.1.tar.gz


Switch to the module's directory. We use Python's distutils to compile and
install the code:

    cd PyLorcon2-0.1
    python setup.py build


If everything went well and no errors are thrown at you, use distutils again to
install PyLorcon2:

    sudo python setup.py install
